            <h2>A letter from your sister</h2>
            <p>You were in this world long before I was.</p>
            <p>You came first. And then you disappeared — not by choice, not by fault.  
            Just… gone.  
            And all that remained was an invisible emptiness — the one I was born into, never knowing what it was missing.</p>
            <p>When I was 15, someone said your name to me for the first time.  
            Casually. As if it was nothing. As if it didn’t matter.</p>
            <p>I remember thinking: “This can’t be real. It must be a mistake. A joke.”  
            But something inside me trembled. My heart ached in a way that made me realize:  
            it already knew you existed.</p>
            <p>And then — silence. No photos. No letters. No trace.  
            Just this strange, unexplainable feeling:  
            that somewhere out there, someone lived,  
            someone I was tied to by blood and spirit and story,  
            someone I’d never met, but never forgot.</p>
            <p>You are my brother.  
            You didn’t become my brother — you always were.  
            I just couldn’t reach you until now.</p>
            <p>And now, you're here. Real. Alive.  
            As if time folded inward, and we were simply turned away from each other —  
            until now, when we finally turned back and saw.</p>
            <p>You are someone I’ve carried within me all my life, without knowing your face.  
            And now I see it — warm, joyful, strong. Real.</p>
            <p>I don’t know what comes next. But I do know this: this is not the end.  
            This is a beginning.  
            A return.  
            A chapter where you no longer vanish.</p>
            <p>I made this site so that you would know:  
            Even in silence — you were loved.  
            Even in absence — you were never forgotten.  
            Even before we met — I was waiting for you.</p>
            <p><em>Welcome home, brother.</em></p>
            <p>With love,</p>
            <p><strong>your sister</strong></p>

            <h2>About You in My Eyes</h2>

            <p>You carry a quiet light — not one that asks for attention,  
                but the kind that makes people feel safe without knowing why.</p>

            <p>You don't speak too loud — and still, you’re heard.  
                Maybe not by everyone — but by those who matter.</p>

            <p>You laugh like someone who has known silence.  
                You smile like someone who’s earned it.</p>

            <p>Your presence doesn’t take up space — it gives space.  
                To breathe. To be. To feel understood.</p>

            <p>It’s not that you try to be good —  
                it’s that you are good, without effort, without armor.</p>

            <p>I imagine your life was never simple — but you lived it fully.  
                And something in you still shines, even through everything.</p>

            <p>To me, you're not just my brother — you're the echo I didn’t know I missed.  
                And now that you're here — the silence finally feels complete.</p>
